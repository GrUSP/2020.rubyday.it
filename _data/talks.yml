  title: Cool, But... Why?
  extract: >
    If you work around Ruby long enough, you’ll learn that certain ideas are just taken as gospel. 
    Don’t use for loops, avoid global state, use symbols pretty much wherever possible. 
    This talk will go deep into the ‘why’ behind some commonly accepted advice on Ruby, dig into the internals, and
    what we find might just surprise you.

  title: OSS - to be defined
  extract: > 
    Enterprises have embraced Open Source software - but their grip is suffocating. 
    Business critical software is plagued by vulnerabilities because of maintainer burnout. 
    We're looking for more sustainable models, and regaining control over what our code can be used for - enter the
    Hippocratic License.
    GitHub taking down software that was vital infrastructure for opposition groups in Spain shows us that no one party
    (let alone company) should own access to open source software.
    The world runs on open source, how do we make sure it can do so sustainably and reliably?

  title: Moving to GraphQL - the fuzzy parts
  extract: >
    We all know the good feeling that comes from starting a green field project and being able to use all the great new
    technology.
    But what if you have a 460k LOC monolith but you really feel that a new GraqhQL API is the way to go. Well, if you
    have good design, you can totally do it, and here's how. GraphQL is all the rage for good reason. It's geared
    towards solving the problems REST API's have when used by modern front-end apps. However, new technology often has
    a way of breaking apart when subjected to legacy projects.
    How easy is it to create a GraphQL API for a commercial project with 7 years of active development and 400k users?
    What difficulties might you encounter that blurbs and blog posts won't tell you about? I'll cover all that and more
    in this riveting tale of fun, sweat and tears (of joy).

  title: "Sequel: When ActiveRecord is not enough"
  extract: > 
    As Rails developers, using ActiveRecord as our database library is a given. As our application grows, we start
    noticing that some of our new requirements aren't exactly supported by the ActiveRecord API.
    So, we pull up our sleeves and write that raw SQL snippet, re-create some queries without models to get that extra
    performance gain, or work around that bug in the library, and move on.
    But gaining this technical debt isn't necessary if you're using a library that supports your advanced use cases.
    Enter Sequel, an alternative ORM for Ruby.
    In this talk we will show some advantages that Sequel has over Active Record, covering topics like the query API,
    building SQL expressions (Arel), connection pools, immutability and more.

  title: The Past, Present, and Future of Rails at GitHub
  extract: >
    On August 15, 2018 GitHub was deployed to production running Rails 5.2.
    This was a historic event; for years GitHub had been behind Rails and dependent on a custom fork of Rails 2.3.
    This talk will visit GitHub’s past, including our tumultuous relationship with the Rails framework, and the grueling
    effort it took to get our application on the latest version.
    You’ll learn what mistakes to avoid and the reasons why such a difficult upgrade was worth it.
    We’ll explore what tracking master means for the future and establish that GitHub and Rails are in it together for
    the long haul.
